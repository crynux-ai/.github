# Crynux Network

Crynux is an open and democratic AI Infrastructure.

As the foundation layer, Crynux Network is composed of the decentralized nodes who contribute their spare AI computing power to the network in exchange for token rewards. The computing power is then grouped and dispatched to run the AI tasks from the developers and applications.

On top of the computing network, a decentralized model/dataset hosting service is provided to better support the various AI use cases.

The applications could easily connect to the Crynux Network using Inference API, bring AI power to their users with no extra need for the hardware and development.

The developers could write codes to train/fine-tune their models on the dataset provided by the network, using the computing power of the network. The developed model could also be hosted on the network as a service for others.

By utilizing the Blockchain, Zero-knowledge Proofs and Privacy Preserving Computation technologies, Crynux aims to build a completely decentralized and trustworthy infrastructure that is always accessible to everyone.

## The Image Generator

The Image Generator is a showcase application on the Hydrogen Network that provides a web interface (just like [`stable-diffusion-webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)) for the users to generate images in the browser. 
The application can be used on any devices that do not have a capable GPU integrated. The Blockchain and token stuff are handled at the application backend. To the end users, this is just a traditional easy-to-use web application, nothing special.

## Getting Started

### Node Provider

If you have the spared local GPU, want to contribute the computing resources to the network in exchange for tokens, [follow this guide](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/join-the-network) to start a node.

### Application Developer

If you have an application, want to use the network to generate images, [follow this guide](https://docs.crynux.ai/application-development/application-workflow) to connect your application to the network.

## Hydrogen Network

Hydrogen Network is the very first testnet of the Crynux Network. Hydrogen Network implements a decentralized AI task execution engine that supports running the Stable Diffusion image generation task.

Everyone has an Nvidia GPU could have already joined the network by starting a Docker container.

And the applications could now send Stable Diffusion image generation tasks to the network using API, and get the images instantly.

To know more about the Hydrogen Network, start from the [Hydrogen Network introduction](https://docs.crynux.ai/hydrogen-network).
