# Crynux Network

Crynux is the REAL decentralized AI infrastructure everyone can join and use right away.

The key component of Crynux is a robust consensus protocol that enables the permissionless joining and using of the decentralized network by millions. The ability to identify and penalize all the malicious behaviors ensures the ecosystem's sustainability and facilitates healthy growth in a long term.

As the foundation layer, Crynux Network is composed of the decentralized nodes who contribute their spare AI computing power to the network in exchange for token rewards. The computing power is then grouped and dispatched to run the AI tasks from the developers and applications.

On top of the computing network, a decentralized model/dataset hosting service is provided to better support the various AI use cases.

The applications could easily connect to the Crynux Network using Inference API, bring AI power to their users with no extra need for the hardware and development.

The developers could write codes to train/fine-tune their models on the dataset provided by the network, using the computing power of the network. The developed model could also be hosted on the network as a service for others.

By utilizing the Blockchain, Zero-knowledge Proofs and Privacy Preserving Computation technologies, Crynux aims to build a completely decentralized and trustworthy infrastructure that is always accessible to everyone.

## The Image Generator

The Image Generator is a showcase application that provides a web interface (just like [`stable-diffusion-webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)) for the users to generate images in the browser. 
The application can be used on any devices that do not have a capable GPU integrated. The Blockchain and token stuff are handled at the application backend using the [Crynux Bridge](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-bridge). To the end users, this is just a traditional easy-to-use web application, nothing special.

## The GPT Chatbot

The GPT Chatbot is a showcase application that provides a simple chat UI in the browser. The web application connects to the [Crynux Bridge](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-bridge) at the backend to interact with the Crynux Network.

## Getting Started

### Start a Node

To start a node on your local computer to earn tokens:

Windows:

[Start a Node on Windows](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/start-a-node-windows)

Mac:

[Start a Node on Mac](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/start-a-node-mac)

Other systems:

[Start a Node using Docker](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/start-a-node-docker)

### Application Developer

If you are an application developer who want to utilize the AI abilities provided by the Crynux Network, [follow this guide](https://docs.crynux.ai/application-development/application-workflow) to connect your application to the network.

## Helium Network

Helium Network is the latest testnet of the Crynux Network. Helium Network implements a decentralized AI task execution engine that supports running the Stable Diffusion image generation tasks and the GPT text generation tasks.
Everyone has an Nvidia GPU, or Mac with the Apple Silicon chips (M1, M2 and M3 series), could have already joined the network by starting a Docker container.

From the application's perspective, it is an inference API service on the cloud that could be used just like AWS. The application submits the Stable Diffusion/GPT tasks to the API, and gets the images/texts in return.

The computation power comes from a decentralized network of the home computers that are coordinated by a consensus protocol running on the Blockchain. The individuals who have the spared computation power could connect their devices to the network, exchanging the computation power for tokens by starting a node, to run the inference tasks for the applications.

Although called a testnet, the featured consensus protocol is robust enough to allow everyone to join at this moment.
