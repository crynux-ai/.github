Crynux is the truly permissionless #DeAI on GPU@edge.

### Truly Permissionless

The key component of Crynux is a robust consensus protocol that enables the permissionless joining and using of the decentralized network by millions.

The ability to identify and penalize all malicious behaviors ensures the ecosystem's sustainability while facilitating healthy growth in the long term.

The innovative [vssML](https://docs.crynux.ai/system-design/verifiable-secret-sampling) technology significantly enhances network efficiency, rivaling centralized platforms while remaining decentralized and permissionless.

### Production-Ready AI Services Cloud, on Edge

As the foundation layer, Crynux Network is composed of the edge nodes, including home computers and mobile devices, who provide hardware to the network in exchange for tokens.

Applications could run tasks such as GPT text generation and Stable Diffusion image generation using various models hosted on the Crynux Network. The integration could be implemented in one-line of code using Crynux SDK.

Model developers use Crynux Network to train/fine-tune their models, and provide models as a service for applications and other developers, earning from the usage of their models.

Mobile devices could also be AI-enhanced by running larger and faster models beyond their current capabilities.

### DeFi Ecosystem built on the Tokenized Model and Data Assets

Building on top of the AI services, an innovative DeFi ecosystem could emerge around "Model Assets" and "Data Assets". All the current DeFi applications could be reimagined using the brand-new assets as their base assets.

For example, the developers of AI models can tokenize the models using Crynux, sharing the rewards from model usage with the model token holders.

Model tokens can be used as collateral in various DeFi applications. These applications can be deployed directly on the Crynux Blockchain or as modular L2 chains that connect to Crynux via cross-chain communication. Existing DeFi applications on other blockchains are also supported.

By utilizing the Blockchain, Zero-knowledge Proofs and Privacy Preserving Computation technologies, Crynux aims to build a completely decentralized and trustless infrastructure that is always accessible to everyone.

## The Image Generator

The Image Generator is a showcase application that provides a web interface (just like [`stable-diffusion-webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)) for the users to generate images in the browser. 
The application can be used on any devices that do not have a capable GPU integrated. The Blockchain and token stuff are handled at the application backend using the [Crynux Bridge](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-bridge). To the end users, this is just a traditional easy-to-use web application, nothing special.

## The GPT Chatbot

The GPT Chatbot is a showcase application that provides a simple chat UI in the browser. The web application connects to the [Crynux Bridge](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-bridge) at the backend to interact with the Crynux Network.

## Getting Started

### Start a Node

To start a node on your local computer to earn tokens:

Windows:

[Start a Node on Windows](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/start-a-node-windows)

Mac:

[Start a Node on Mac](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/start-a-node-mac)

Other systems:

[Start a Node using Docker](https://docs.crynux.ai/node-hosting/start-a-node-docker)

### Application Developer

If you are an application developer who want to utilize the AI abilities provided by the Crynux Network, [follow this guide](https://docs.crynux.ai/application-development/application-workflow) to connect your application to the network.

## Helium Network

Helium Network is the latest testnet of the Crynux Network. Helium Network implements a decentralized AI task execution engine that supports running the Stable Diffusion image generation tasks and the GPT text generation tasks.
Everyone has an Nvidia GPU, or Mac with the Apple Silicon chips (M1, M2 and M3 series), could have already joined the network by starting a Docker container.

From the application's perspective, it is an inference API service on the cloud that could be used just like AWS. The application submits the Stable Diffusion/GPT tasks to the API, and gets the images/texts in return.

The computation power comes from a decentralized network of the home computers that are coordinated by a consensus protocol running on the Blockchain. The individuals who have the spared computation power could connect their devices to the network, exchanging the computation power for tokens by starting a node, to run the inference tasks for the applications.

Although called a testnet, the featured consensus protocol is robust enough to allow everyone to join at this moment.

To know more about the Helium Network, start from the [Helium Network introduction](https://docs.crynux.ai/releases/helium-network).
